      You might think: "BUT I DON'T KNOW CSS" (_very well_ or _at all_). Developers
_constantly_ encounter this feeling. Since developers are constantly learning,
we try to keep the commands as simple as possible. You might know more than you
think! What happens if you change `red` to `green`? What do you expect? How
would you validate your guess? Developers usually call this process "trying
stuff" or "messing around" or "playing with stuff." While all those phrases
sound like a joke, what they mean to say is that they're using the Scientific
Method to validate their guesses into building a model.

It's possibly the most powerful learning technique possible. Toddlers and
puppies are amazing at it!
